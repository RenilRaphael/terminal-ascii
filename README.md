# terminal-ascii
Simple Python programming to convert given image file into ASCII.
YOUR TERMINAL BACKGROUND HAS TO BE BLACK...or at the very least darker than your font colour!!
Use 'ctrl' + '-' to zoom out in terminal to see that image.
Works best on windows powershell. 
PS worked on the project without git and then simply uploaded to github once finished.
